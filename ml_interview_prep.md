# ML/DS Interview prep

OK so you have ML base. Maybe you took a couple of courses. You've done a couple of ML projects. You're ready for a job!  Well, maybe. ML technical interviews are pretty tough. Here is my guide to surviving an interview. Depending on your strengths and weaknesses, I'd recommend at least prepping 20 hrs/week for a month. Focus on your weaknesses, and constantly evaluate. Always work on the highest ROI for you.

## Core components

* Coding: LeetCode question
* System design: how would you design twitter?
* ML case study: Here is some data on wine reviews. How would you make a wine recommender?
* ML/Stats questions: Rapid fire questions.
* Cultural interview: AKA Tradition interview
* GitHub/Technical review of a project

## A _typical_ interview
Every company is different, but this seems to be the average set-up:

* Technical or cultural phone screen
* Onsite 3-8 hrs

## Coding
Most places will have you do a coding question. These are typically just called "[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)" questions.  Check out Leet code get a sense of what I mean. This will either be done as a white boarding question or on [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/) over the phone. These are most likely going to be an easy or medium LeetCode question. I did around 50 questions (mostly easy). Practice doing these on the whiteboard in front of someone if you can. Data science warning: you may be asked an SQL question.

## System design
The interview is looking for your ability to solve open-ended questions, how easy you are to collaborate with, and your understanding of software engineering concepts (APIs, databases, messaging queues, etc.  Ask a million questions and let them guide you through it. Check out videos like [design a parking lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSGsa0pu8-k). The tough part of these having to learn about various types of databases and tools, but this will most likely only be at a high level. Try and do 1-3 of these in front of someone. They usually last 30-60 minutes.

## ML case study
This is like a system design question, but more focused on a data driven problem. You'll be given a problem and be asked how you can use ML to solve it. Like a system design, ask a million questions.  Be prepared to discuss models you'd pick and be able to defend your choice. You may need to design features, figure out how you'd collect data, etc.

## ML/Stats questions
This will be like a rapid fire round be prepared to answer questions like: what's bias/variance trade-off? Bagging? Bootstrap? Regularization? Type I vs Type II error? Precision vs recall? Check out these [ML interview questions](https://www.springboard.com/blog/machine-learning-interview-questions/). The questions seemed good, but I didn't look through the answers so I wouldn't assume they are correct. Data science warning: you may be asked a SQL question.

## Cultural interview
This is the traditional interview part of the interview, but don't skip this if you think you're good at talk to people. Be familiar with the [START method](http://theinterviewpro.com/tstart-method/). Think about possible interview questions, and have something prepared. When was a time you had to meet a deadline? When was a time you failed? What are your weaknesses? Keep answers to 1-1.5 minutes, and make it a conversation if you can.

## GitHub/Technical review of a project
Git is an essential tool, and I would be shocked if someone was hired without one. It's fine to put rough projects on there, but make sure your pinned repos are nice and have a README. Take a look at [My github](https://github.com/mstefferson) for an example. You should have at least one project that is really clean with a badass README. It should also be a ML/DS project. Check out [My Insight project](https://github.com/mstefferson/Canopy) for an example. I'd also recommend looking at the code to a sense of what nice code looks like. Start linting you code now! There are plugins for all major editors. I use Syntanstic. It's super easy to do and makes your codebase look a million times better.
